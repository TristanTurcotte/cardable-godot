# Cardable game concepts

This document would be used to describe the basic game concepts that are made available to content creators to use as the building blocks for their games.

Concepts such as a deck that can be shuffled and drawn from, or how cards can be held in a 'hand' or placed on a 'table'/'play area' in a particular spot. Or how players can be placed in groups so they operate together in the state system, for example playing rounds/turns. Or how actions can declare a transition to a state with custom provided data to 'kickstart' the next state.

## Card concepts

What can cards do? How can they be interacted with?
